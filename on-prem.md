### Cost Categories

1. **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**:
   - Initial purchase of hardware and software.
   - Infrastructure setup costs.

2. **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**:
   - Ongoing maintenance and upgrades.
   - Electricity and cooling.
   - IT staff salaries and training.
   - Security and compliance costs.

3. **Hidden Costs**:
   - Downtime and outages.
   - Inefficiencies due to aging hardware.
   - Scalability limitations.

Managing on-premise servers requires significant initial investment and ongoing costs, making it crucial to assess the total cost of ownership (TCO) when deciding between on-premise and cloud solutions.
