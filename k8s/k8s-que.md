           app: my-app
         ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 80
             targetPort: 80
         type: LoadBalancer
       ```
     - **Apply the Service YAML File:**
       ```bash
       kubectl apply -f service.yaml
       ```

### 6. **What is a Kubernetes Namespace, and Why Use Multiple Namespaces?**

- **Definition:**
  - A Namespace is a logical partition within a Kubernetes cluster.

- **Usage:**
  - **Isolation:** Separate resources for different teams or projects.
  - **Resource Quotas:** Set limits on resources within each namespace.
  - **Access Control:** Apply policies and permissions on a per-namespace basis.

### 7. **Concept of Kubernetes Services and Their Role in Network Connectivity for Pods**

- **Definition:**
  - A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them.

- **Types:**
  - **ClusterIP:** Default, exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.
  - **NodePort:** Exposes the service on a static port on each node.
  - **LoadBalancer:** Provisions an external load balancer.

### 8. **Role of a Kubernetes Ingress Controller and How It Works**

- **Definition:**
  - An Ingress Controller manages inbound traffic to Kubernetes services based on Ingress rules.
