### 3. **How do you deploy a containerized application on a Kubernetes cluster? Walk me through the process.**

1. **Create a Docker Image:**
   - Build your container image and push it to a container registry.
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp:latest .
   docker push myapp:latest
   ```

2. **Define a Deployment YAML:**
   - Create a Deployment configuration file (`deployment.yaml`).
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp
           image: myapp:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

3. **Apply the Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application to the cluster.
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

4. **Expose the Deployment:**
   - Create a Service to expose the Deployment.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: myapp-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: myapp
     ports:
     - protocol: TCP
       port: 80
       targetPort: 80
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

### 4. **Describe Kubernetes Deployments and StatefulSets. What are the differences, and when would you use one over the other?**

| **Aspect**          | **Deployment**                                                   | **StatefulSet**                                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Manages stateless applications.                                   | Manages stateful applications with persistent storage.             |
| **Scaling**         | Supports scaling up or down easily.                               | Handles scaling with stable network identities and storage.         |
| **Pods**            | Pods are created and destroyed without stable identifiers.       | Pods have persistent names and stable network IDs.                 |
| **Storage**         | Ephemeral storage; not suited for applications needing persistent storage. | Persistent storage through Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).        |
| **Use Case**        | Suitable for stateless applications like web servers.            | Suitable for databases and applications requiring stable identities. |

### 5. **How does Kubernetes handle load balancing for containerized applications?**

- **Internal Load Balancing:** 
  - **Service:** Kubernetes Service resources automatically load balance traffic to Pods using a round-robin algorithm.
- **External Load Balancing:**
  - **LoadBalancer Service:** Requests are routed through an external load balancer provided by cloud providers (e.g., AWS ELB).
  - **Ingress:** Manages external HTTP/HTTPS traffic and provides routing rules to Services.

### 6. **What is a Kubernetes Namespace, and why would you use multiple namespaces in a cluster?**

- **Namespace:** A way to divide a single Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters.
- **Reasons for Multiple Namespaces:**
  - **Isolation:** Separate environments for different teams or projects.
  - **Resource Quotas:** Apply resource quotas per namespace to manage resources.
  - **Access Control:** Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions within namespaces.

### 7. **Explain the concept of Kubernetes Services and how they enable network connectivity for Pods.**

- **Service:** An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them.
- **Types:**

     spec:
       scaleTargetRef:
         apiVersion: apps/v1
         kind: Deployment
         name: myapp-deployment
       minReplicas: 1
       maxReplicas: 10
       targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
     ```
  3. **Apply HPA:**
     ```bash

|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rolling Update**  | Gradually updates Pods with new versions.                         | Use for continuous deployments with minimal downtime. |
| **Canary Deployment** | Releases a new version to a small subset of users first.           | Use for testing new features with a limited audience before full rollout. |

### 11. **Explain Kubernetes' role in self-healing and how it handles container failures.**

- **Self-Healing:**
  - **Liveness Probes:** Check if a container is alive; restart if it fails.
  - **Readiness Probes:** Check if a container is ready to serve traffic; remove from service if not.
  - **ReplicaSets:** Ensure the desired number of Pods are running; replace Pods if they fail.

### 12. **What are Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets, and how do they differ in terms of storing configuration data?**

| **Aspect**          | **ConfigMap**                                | **Secret**                                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Stores non-sensitive configuration data.    | Stores sensitive data like passwords and tokens.    |
| **Data Handling**   | Data is stored in plain text.                | Data is encoded and can be encrypted.               |
| **Use Case**        | Application configuration.                   | Secure credentials and sensitive configuration.     |
